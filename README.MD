# Cytoscape Partnerships

This app uses Cytoscape.js to visualise partnerships that the projects within the consortium have.

## How it Works

Nodes are specified in `data/nodes.json` and then how those nodes are connected is specified in `data/edges.js`. This information is then used to plot the network.

## How to Run

1. Run `yarn` to install the dependencies
2. Run `yarn dev` to run locally.
